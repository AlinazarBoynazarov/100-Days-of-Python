Dear [NAME],

I hope this letter finds you well on your special day. Today is your birthday, and I wanted to take the time to let you know how much you mean to me.

Over the years, you have been there for me through thick and thin. You have always been a shoulder to cry on, a listening ear, and a source of endless support and love. I am so grateful to have you as a friend, and I am lucky to have someone like you in my life.

On this birthday, I wish you all the best. May your day be filled with love, laughter, and happiness, and may the year ahead be even better. You deserve the very best, and I hope that this birthday brings you everything you desire and more.

Here's to another year of friendship and to many more to come. Happy birthday!

With love,
Your Name
